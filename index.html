       maybe you dont like jelly? its all good honey is a great substitute. here is a way to make a great peanut butter and honey sandwhich.
        <h1>step 1= spread honey on two pieces of toast<h/1>
        step 2= spread peanut butter on another piece of bread, (make sure you dont put the honey and peanut butter together because they dont mix that well).
        step 3= put the honey toast, honey side down on the peanut butter sandwhich.
        step 4= cut the bread diagonal and your set!
